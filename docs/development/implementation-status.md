# Backend Implementation TODO Summary

Based on the frontend implementation analysis, this document summarizes the key features that have been implemented in the backend to support the AI Interview application.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

The backend follows a **simplified 2-layer architecture**:
- **API Layer**: HTTP handlers, routing, request processing, and business logic
- **Data Layer**: Hybrid store (memory/database), data models, and repositories
- **AI Layer**: AI service integration and evaluation logic

**Note**: The business layer was removed as it contained only TODO comments and was not being used. All business logic is now handled directly in the API handlers for simplicity and maintainability.

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Priority 1: Core Chat-Based Interview API**

~~The frontend heavily relies on conversational interview functionality. These endpoints are **critical**:~~

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED Chat API Endpoints**
- ✅ `POST /interviews/{id}/chat/start` - Initialize chat session
- ✅ `POST /chat/{sessionId}/message` - Send message and get AI response  
- ✅ `GET /chat/{sessionId}` - Retrieve chat session state
- ✅ `POST /chat/{sessionId}/end` - End session and generate evaluation

### ✅ **COMPLETED Implementation Requirements**
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Real AI service calls implemented with multiple providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Mock)
- ✅ **Session Management**: Chat sessions and messages stored in memory store
- ✅ **Conversation Flow**: AI generates contextual responses and knows when to end interviews
- ✅ **Evaluation Generation**: Chat history converted to evaluation with real AI scoring

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Priority 2: Traditional Q&A Interview API**

### ✅ **COMPLETED Traditional Q&A Evaluation**
The traditional Q&A evaluation endpoints now use real AI evaluation logic:

#### ✅ SubmitEvaluationHandler (Traditional Q&A)
- ✅ Generate real evaluation ID instead of "sample-eval-id"
- ✅ Implement real AI evaluation for traditional Q&A format
- ✅ Validate interview exists before creating evaluation
- ✅ Store evaluation in memory store instead of mock response

#### ✅ GetEvaluationHandler
- ✅ Implement memory store lookup by evaluation ID
- ✅ Handle not found cases with proper error response
- ✅ Include actual answers in response
- ❌ Include associated interview data if needed
- ❌ Add access control/authorization if needed

### ✅ **COMPLETED Priority 2.1: Enhanced Interview Listing**

- ✅ **Full Feature Parity**: Both backends support all operations (CRUD, pagination, filtering, sorting)
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL backend ensures data survives restarts and deployments
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Memory backend for fast development, database backend for production scale

## 🎯 Priority 3: Enhanced Data Models

### Missing Database Tables
```sql

CREATE TABLE files (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    original_name VARCHAR,
    file_path VARCHAR,
    file_size BIGINT,
    content_type VARCHAR,
    interview_id VARCHAR REFERENCES interviews(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
