# Backend Implementation TODO Summary

Based on the frontend implementation analysis, this document summarizes the key features that need to be implemented in the backend to support the AI Interview application.

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Priority 1: Core Chat-Based Interview API**

~~The frontend heavily relies on conversational interview functionality. These endpoints are **critical**:~~

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED Chat API Endpoints**
- ✅ `POST /interviews/{id}/chat/start` - Initialize chat session
- ✅ `POST /chat/{sessionId}/message` - Send message and get AI response  
- ✅ `GET /chat/{sessionId}` - Retrieve chat session state
- ✅ `POST /chat/{sessionId}/end` - End session and generate evaluation

### ✅ **COMPLETED Implementation Requirements**
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Real AI service calls implemented with multiple providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Mock)
- ✅ **Session Management**: Chat sessions and messages stored in memory store
- ✅ **Conversation Flow**: AI generates contextual responses and knows when to end interviews
- ✅ **Evaluation Generation**: Chat history converted to evaluation with real AI scoring

## ✅ **COMPLETED - Priority 2: Traditional Q&A Interview API**

### ✅ **COMPLETED Traditional Q&A Evaluation**
The traditional Q&A evaluation endpoints now use real AI evaluation logic:

#### ✅ SubmitEvaluationHandler (Traditional Q&A)
- ✅ Generate real evaluation ID instead of "sample-eval-id"
- ✅ Implement real AI evaluation for traditional Q&A format
- ✅ Validate interview exists before creating evaluation
- ✅ Store evaluation in memory store instead of mock response

#### ✅ GetEvaluationHandler
- ✅ Implement memory store lookup by evaluation ID
- ✅ Handle not found cases with proper error response
- ✅ Include actual answers in response
- ❌ Include associated interview data if needed
- ❌ Add access control/authorization if needed

### ✅ **COMPLETED Priority 2.1: Enhanced Interview Listing**

#### ✅ ListInterviewsHandler (FULLY IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ **Memory Store Enhancement**: Added `GetInterviewsWithOptions` method with comprehensive pagination, filtering, and sorting
- ✅ **Real Handler Implementation**: Replaced mock implementation with actual memory store queries
- ✅ **Pagination Support**: Full pagination with limit, offset, page parameters and metadata
- ✅ **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by candidate name, interview status, and date range
- ✅ **Flexible Sorting**: Sort by date, candidate name, or status with ascending/descending order
- ✅ **Query Parameter Parsing**: Added `parseIntQuery` helper with robust validation
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite covering pagination, filtering, sorting, and edge cases
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: Enhanced API service with query parameter support
- ✅ **UI Enhancement**: Added search controls, pagination component, and results summary
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Added translation keys for new UI elements (English + Chinese)
- ✅ **Mock Data Expansion**: Added 12+ diverse interview entries for testing

### Remaining Priority 2 TODOs
- ❌ Real database implementation (currently using enhanced memory store)
- ❌ Database migration setup for traditional Q&A tables  
- ❌ Repository pattern implementation for production database

## 🎯 Priority 3: Enhanced Data Models

### Missing Database Tables
```sql
-- File uploads for resumes (chat sessions already implemented in memory store)
CREATE TABLE files (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    original_name VARCHAR,
    file_path VARCHAR,
    file_size BIGINT,
    content_type VARCHAR,
    interview_id VARCHAR REFERENCES interviews(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### ✅ **COMPLETED DTO Updates**
- ✅ Add `Total` field to `ListInterviewsResponseDTO` for pagination
- ✅ Add pagination metadata (Page, Limit, TotalPages) to response
- ✅ Enhanced interview listing response with comprehensive pagination data
- ❌ Add `Answers` field to traditional `EvaluationResponseDTO` (chat evaluation already working)

## 🎯 Priority 4: AI Service Integration

~~### Required AI Capabilities~~
~~1. **Chat Response Generation**: Generate contextual interview questions and responses~~
~~2. **Interview Evaluation**: Score answers and provide detailed feedback~~
~~3. **Question Generation**: Create questions from resume content and job descriptions~~
~~4. **Conversation Management**: Know when to end interviews (after 8-10 exchanges)~~

### ✅ **COMPLETED AI Integration**
- ✅ **Chat Response Generation**: Implemented with context-aware responses
- ✅ **Interview Evaluation**: Real AI scoring with detailed feedback for both chat and traditional Q&A
- ✅ **Question Generation**: Available via `GenerateQuestionsFromResume()`
- ✅ **Conversation Management**: Smart interview ending logic implemented

### Remaining AI TODOs
- ❌ Resume text extraction and question generation pipeline
- ❌ Advanced AI prompt engineering for different interview types

## 🎯 Priority 5: Business Logic Implementation

### ✅ **COMPLETED Interview Service**
- ✅ Create interviews with predefined or AI-generated questions
- ✅ Handle different interview types (general, technical, behavioral)  
- ✅ Manage interview lifecycle (draft → active → completed)
- ❌ Support resume upload and processing

### ✅ **COMPLETED Evaluation Service**
- ✅ Process traditional Q&A evaluations with real AI
- ✅ Handle chat-based interview evaluations
- ✅ Generate detailed feedback with suggestions
- ✅ Calculate scores based on answer quality

### ✅ **COMPLETED Chat Service**
- ✅ Manage chat session lifecycle
- ✅ Generate contextual AI responses
- ✅ Track conversation progress
- ✅ Convert chat to evaluation format

## 🎯 Priority 6: Production Features

### Security & Validation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend domains
- Request/response logging

### File Upload
- Resume upload handling
- File type validation (PDF, DOC, etc.)
- Text extraction from documents
- Secure file storage

### Database
- Connection pooling configuration
- Database migrations
- Proper indexing for performance
- Transaction management

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics collection
- Error tracking and logging
- Performance monitoring

## 📊 Frontend-Backend API Alignment

   export DATABASE_URL="your-postgres-url"
   export UPLOAD_PATH="./uploads"
   ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Run migrations for chat tables
   - Add indexes for performance
   - Set up connection pooling

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Choose AI provider (OpenAI recommended)
   - Implement client in `ai/client.go`
   - Test with simple prompts

4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Set frontend to use real API (`USE_MOCK_DATA = false`)
   - Test chat functionality end-to-end
   - Verify evaluation generation

## 📝 Notes from Frontend Analysis

- Frontend has comprehensive mock API showing expected behavior
- Internationalization support (English + Traditional Chinese)
- Material-UI components with responsive design
- Real-time chat interface with typing indicators
- File upload UI for resume processing
- Evaluation results display with detailed feedback

The backend needs to match the mock API functionality exactly to ensure seamless integration.
